Our tracking system was developed as a web application written in JavaScript with Node and React and Three.js. We implemented a rendered for Three.js called React-three-fiber which allows us to load 3D models of the ISS itself, the nearby satellites, and all the space trash data into a space.\nThe application relies on the TLE data provided from Celestrak (considering NORAD and NASA's GOES data) and an API provided from Open Notify which provides us the ISS position in real time.",

The project was developed for the HackMTY 2022 Hackathon, with the goal of creating a better resource management.\nThis project aims to use artificial vision to detect and sort garbage. The project is divided into two main parts:\nPython files with trained artificial intelligence: These files contain the deep learning model that has been trained to recognize and classify different types of garbage.\nServer to interpret in React: This server is used to interpret and process the data collected by the AI model. It is likely that it will be used to control the sorting and disposal of the garbage.\nMatlab scripts are used to analyze the training data and evaluate the performance of the model.\nThe system is described as using artificial vision to detect the garbage and then using the trained AI model to classify and sort it. The results are then interpreted and processed by the server and possibly used to control the disposal of the garbage.\nThis project involves training a deep learning model for image recognition, specifically using the GoogleNet architecture, to classify different types of garbage (such as organic, plastics, paper, and others). The trained model is then integrated into a prototype system for automated control, which is designed to function as an 'intelligent' garbage bin. The system is able to use the image recognition model to distinguish between different types of garbage and sort them into the appropriate bin. The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of waste sorting in households and communities.",

The system was first developed in electron, which allows the creation of animations of the car and real-time tracking of its position on a map. The second version of the system was built using C# and .NET, where the team can view more detailed information about the car on a dashboard. The system allows the team to view important data such as speed, angles of inclination, temperature, and geographic coordinates in real-time. This information can be used to analyze the car's performance, monitor the car status, and make adjustments to optimize the car's performance during the prototype phase. The system can be integrated into the car's onboard computer or connected to a separate monitoring device, making it a valuable tool for any team developing a prototype electric car.",

The code would also include logic to handle input from the user, such as button presses to select a candy and insert money, as well as logic to control the dispensing mechanism and handle output, such as displaying the amount of money inserted and the available candy options.
