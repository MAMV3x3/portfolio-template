Our tracking system was developed as a web application written in JavaScript with Node and React and Three.js. We implemented a rendered for Three.js called React-three-fiber which allows us to load 3D models of the ISS itself, the nearby satellites, and all the space trash data into a space.\nThe application relies on the TLE data provided from Celestrak (considering NORAD and NASA's GOES data) and an API provided from Open Notify which provides us the ISS position in real time.",

        "about": "Our team has developed a cutting-edge solution to address one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time - improper waste sorting. The project was developed for the HackMTY 2022 Hackathon, with the goal of creating a better resource management.\nThis project aims to use artificial vision to detect and sort garbage. The project is divided into two main parts:\nPython files with trained artificial intelligence: These files contain the deep learning model that has been trained to recognize and classify different types of garbage.\nServer to interpret in React: This server is used to interpret and process the data collected by the AI model. It is likely that it will be used to control the sorting and disposal of the garbage.\nMatlab scripts are used to analyze the training data and evaluate the performance of the model.\nThe system is described as using artificial vision to detect the garbage and then using the trained AI model to classify and sort it. The results are then interpreted and processed by the server and possibly used to control the disposal of the garbage.\nThis project involves training a deep learning model for image recognition, specifically using the GoogleNet architecture, to classify different types of garbage (such as organic, plastics, paper, and others). The trained model is then integrated into a prototype system for automated control, which is designed to function as an 'intelligent' garbage bin. The system is able to use the image recognition model to distinguish between different types of garbage and sort them into the appropriate bin. The goal of this project is to improve the efficiency of waste sorting in households and communities.",
